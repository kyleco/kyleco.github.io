2. What is the treatment ($$D$$)?
3. What causal relationship is stated explicitly or implied by the study?
4. Describe a mechanism that could cause selection bias in the story. Which direction does the bias go?
5. Describe a mechanism that could cause differential effect bias. Which direction does the bias go?
6. Describe what it would mean if the independence assumption was true in this study.
7. Describe how you would do a true randomized experiment to study this causal relationship.
